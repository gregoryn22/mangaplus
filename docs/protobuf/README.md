# Java to Proto Converter

This tool parses Java classes generated by the Protobuf compiler (`protoc`) and reconstructs the original `.proto` definitions.
It is useful when the `.proto` files are missing but compiled Java sources are available.

## Features

* Extracts package, imports, messages, and enums from generated Java classes.
* Converts Java field definitions back into valid `.proto` fields.
* Handles `Internal.ProtobufList<>` and common Java to Proto type mappings.
* Outputs clean, human-readable `.proto` files.

## Usage

1. Place a compiled Java protobuf file (e.g., `compiled.java`) in the project directory.
2. Run the parser:

   ```bash
   python parser.py
   ```
3. The tool generates a `.proto` file under `protos/` matching the Java class name.

## Example

Input: `compiled.java` (generated by protoc to javac)
Output: `protos/Chapter.proto` (original `.proto` reconstruction)

## Notes

* Currently supports **proto3** syntax.
* Type inference covers common primitives (`int`, `String`, `boolean`) and nested messages/enums.
* Unknown or custom mappings are left as `unknown`.
